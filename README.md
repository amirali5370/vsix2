# Python extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) with rich support for the [Python language](https://www.python.org/) (_including Python 3.6_), with features such as linting, debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more!

## Quick Start

* **Step 1.** [Install a supported version of Python on your system](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites) (note: that the system install of Python on macOS is not supported)
* **Step 2.** Install the extension
* **Step 3.** Open or create a Python file and start coding!

### Optional
* **Step 4.** [Install a linter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) to get errors and warnings -- you can further customize linting rules to fit your needs
* **Step 5.** Select your preferred Python interpreter
  + By default we use the one that's on your path
  + To select a different Python interpreter/version/environment (use the command `Select Interpreter`, or if you have a workspace open you can click in the status bar)
* **Step 6.** Install `ctags` for Workspace Symbols, from [here](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), or using `brew install ctags` on macOS

You can [follow our Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites) for step-by-step instructions for building a simple app, and check out the [Python documentation on the VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for more information.

## Useful Commands

Open the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux) and type in one of the following commands:

Command | Description 
--- | --- 
```Python: Select Interpreter``` | Switch between Python interpreters, versions, and environments.
```Python: Start REPL``` | Start an interactive Python REPL using the selected interpreter in the VS Code terminal.
```Python: Run Python File in Terminal``` | Runs the active Python file in the VS Code terminal. You can also run a Python file by right-clicking on the file and selecting ```Run Python File in Terminal```.
```Python: Select Linter``` | Switch from PyLint to flake8 or other supported linters.
