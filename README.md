# Python extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) with rich support for the [Python language](https://www.python.org/) (for all [actively supported versions](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) of the language: 2.7, >=3.5), including features such as IntelliSense, linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, Jupyter notebook support, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, snippets, and more!

## Quick start

* **Step 1.** [Install a supported version of Python on your system](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites) (note: that the system install of Python on macOS is not supported).
* **Step 2.** Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.
* **Step 3.** Open or create a Python file and start coding!

## Get the best out of the Python extension
* Select your preferred Python interpreter/version/environment using the `Select Interpreter` command on the Command Palette.
  + By default we use the one that's on your path.
  + If you have a workspace open you can also click in the status bar to change the interpreter.

*  [Install a linter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) to get errors and warnings -- you can further customize linting rules to fit your needs.
* Install `ctags` for Workspace Symbols from [here](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), or using `brew install ctags` on macOS, to improve performance of code navigation.

For more information you can:
* [Follow our Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites) with step-by-step instructions for building a simple app.
* Check out the [Python documentation on the VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for general information about using the extension.

## Useful commands

Open the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux) and type in one of the following commands:

Command | Description
--- | ---
```Python: Select Interpreter``` | Switch between Python interpreters, versions, and environments.
```Python: Start REPL``` | Start an interactive Python REPL using the selected interpreter in the VS Code terminal.
```Python: Run Python File in Terminal``` | Runs the active Python file in the VS Code terminal. You can also run a Python file by right-clicking on the file and selecting ```Run Python File in Terminal```.
```Python: Select Linter``` | Switch from PyLint to flake8 or other supported linters.
```Format Document``` |Formats code using the provided [formatter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting) in the ``settings.json`` file. |

To see all available Python commands, open the Command Palette and type ```Python```.
