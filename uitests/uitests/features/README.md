# Tags

-   @wip
    -   Used only for debugging purposes.
    -   When debugging in VSC, only features/scenarios with @wip tag will be executed.
-   @skip
    -   Used to skip a feature/scenario.
-   @https://github.com/xxx/yyy.git
    -   Can only be used at a feature level.
    -   The conents of the above repo will be used as the contents of the workspace folder.
    -   Note: assume the tag is `@https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pyvscSmokeTesting.git`
        -   The above repo is cloned directly into the workspace.
    -   If however the tag is `@https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pyvscSmokeTesting/testing`
        -   Now, the contents of the workspace is the `tests` directory in the above repo.
    -   This allows us to have a single repo with files/tests for more than just one feature/scenario.
    -   Else we'd need to have multiple repos for each feature/scenario.
-   @preserve.workspace

    -   Ensures the previous workspace state is used for testing.
    -   I.e. state setup in previous state is not reset (makes it easier to re-use state from preivous scenarios).
    -   Useful for scenarios that are difficult and time consuming to setup.
    -   E.g. creating virtual environments.
    -   To be decided whether we drop this all together
        -   Or just collapse all tests into one
