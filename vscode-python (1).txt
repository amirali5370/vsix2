README.md 
Python extension for Visual Studio Code
A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported versions of the language: >=3.7), including features such as IntelliSense (Pylance), linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!
Support for vscode.dev
The Python extension does offer some support when running on vscode.dev (which includes github.dev). This includes partial IntelliSense for open files in the editor.
Installed extensions
The Python extension will automatically install the Pylance and Jupyter extensions to give you the best experience when working with Python files and Jupyter notebooks. However, Pylance is an optional dependency, meaning the Python extension will remain fully functional if it fails to be installed. You can also uninstall it at the expense of some features if you’re using a different language server.
Extensions installed through the marketplace are subject to the Marketplace Terms of Use.
Quick start
    • Step 1. Install a supported version of Python on your system (note: that the system install of Python on macOS is not supported). 
    • Step 2. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. 
    • Step 3. Open or create a Python file and start coding! 
Set up your environment
    • Select your Python interpreter by clicking on the status bar
       
    • Configure the debugger through the Debug Activity Bar
       
    • Configure tests by running the Configure Tests command
       
Jupyter Notebook quick start
The Python extension and the Jupyter extension work together to give you a great Notebook experience in VS Code.
    • Open or create a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and start coding in our Notebook Editor!
       
For more information you can:
    • Follow our Python tutorial with step-by-step instructions for building a simple app. 
    • Check out the Python documentation on the VS Code site for general information about using the extension. 
    • Check out the Jupyter Notebook documentation on the VS Code site for information about using Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.
