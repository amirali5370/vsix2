Updated the [language server](https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server) to [0.1.57/2018.11.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server/releases/tag/2018.11.0) (from 2018.10.0)
and the [debugger](https://pypi.org/project/ptvsd/) to
[4.2.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/ptvsd/releases/tag/v4.2.0) (from 4.1.3). Highlights include:
* Language server
  - Completions on generic containers work (e.g. `x: List[T]` now have completions for `x`, not just `x[]`).
  - Fixed issues relating to `Go to Definition` for `from ... import` statements.
  - `None` is no longer flagged as undefined.
  - `BadSourceException` should no longer be raised.
  - Fixed a null reference exception when handling certain function overloads.
* Debugger
  - Properly deal with handled or unhandled exception in top level frames.
  - Any folder ending with `site-packages` is considered a library.
  - Treat any code not in `site-packages` as user code.
  - Handle case where no completions are provided by the debugger.
