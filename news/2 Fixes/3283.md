Always use bundled version of [`ptvsd`](https://github.com/microsoft/ptvsd), unless specified.
To use a custom version of `ptvsd` in the debugger, add `customDebugger` into your `launch.json` configuration as follows:
```js
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "customDebugger": true
```
